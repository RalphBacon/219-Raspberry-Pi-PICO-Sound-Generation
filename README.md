So I'm experimenting with sound generation using square waves (PWM) and a small beeper. Pretty awful screechy stuff, to be honest, but it will (probably) suffice for a simple notification that the fridge door has been left open.

We're using MicroPython just for grins and giggles, although C++ would work just fine too on the PICO.
